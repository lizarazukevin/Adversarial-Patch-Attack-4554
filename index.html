<h3>Abstract</h3>
Vulnerabilities and exploitations are always apparent in a world where adversaries exist to wreck havoc on the systems that keep us safe and maintain order in society.
With most modern systems becoming more automated, keeping humans out of the loop, places us at the mercy of these black box algorithms that many times
are affected by the small perturbations, many of which are imperctible to humans.

<!-- Introduction -->
<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
Object detection systems have seen widespread use in recent years with the rapid development of computational resources and improved machine learning algorithms, allowing for even the most complex detectors to be able to deploy on systems “on the edge”, in environments and settings which would not have been possible only a decade ago. Object detection systems today are used for various applications such as autonomous vehicle navigation, security systems, and applications that require an object's tracking. More use cases and applications that can use object detectors are constantly being found and developed. However, as we become more dependent on object detectors to perform critical tasks, such as identifying security threats and safely navigating autonomous vehicles, the issue of robustness in a world where adversaries exist is one that must be addressed.
<br> <br>There are two main types of adversarial attacks that we identify. The first is an attack aimed directly at the physical device performing the detection, which prevents the device from actually performing object detection. The second is an attack aimed at the classification that the detector performs, and attempts to mislead the detector as to what it is actually detecting. For this project, we will focus on the latter. Specifically, we will attempt to first successfully create an object detection system that identifies pedestrians and vehicles. The framework used to train this object detection system will then be used to create an adversarial patch attack that will successfully interfere with the classification of objects within an image given that there is knowledge about the dataset it was trained on as well. With this project we aim to exploit vulnerabilities by going to the lengths that adversarial partners would take to mess with automated systems that keep the public safe and in-check.

<!-- Approach -->
<h3>Approach</h3>
Describe very clearly and systematically your approach to solve the problem. Tell us exactly what existing implementations you used to build your system. Tell us what obstacles you faced and how you addressed them. Justify any design choices or judgment calls you made in your approach.

<br><br>
<!-- Results -->
<h3>Experiments and results</h3>
Provide details about the experimental set up (number of images/videos, number of datasets you experimented with, train/test split if you used machine learning algorithms, etc.). Describe the evaluation metrics you used to evaluate how well your approach is working. Include clear figures and tables, as well as illustrative qualitative examples if appropriate. Be sure to include obvious baselines to see if your approach is doing better than a naive approach (e.g. for classification accuracy, how well would a classifier do that made random decisions?). Also discuss any parameters of your algorithms, and tell us how you set the values of those parameters. You can also show us how the performance varies as you change those parameter values. Be sure to discuss any trends you see in your results, and explain why these trends make sense. Are the results as expected? Why?
